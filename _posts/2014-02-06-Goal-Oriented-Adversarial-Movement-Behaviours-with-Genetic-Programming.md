### Abstract ###

Genetic programming has been successfully applied in numerous game-based contexts.
Though a popular construct in game development, industry tends to favour manually coded rather than generated behaviour trees despite their demonstrated performance.

This work applies genetic programming to determine a behaviour tree capable of moving an agent through an environment to a goal location whilst avoiding detection.

Tests using five alternate game maps show the potential of the technique to solve this problem.
