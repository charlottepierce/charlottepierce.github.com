	<h1>What's all this, then?</h1>
	<p>
	My name is Charlotte Pierce, and I'm an honours student in computer science at Swinburne University of Technology.
	</p>
	<p>
	I'm hoping that it still sounds legitimate for me to say that I don't have any overly specific 'research interests' yet, but if not just pretend I'm working on something that at least <i>sounds</i> important and interesting.
	</p>
	<p>
	This is mostly a place for me to put up random bits of work work and notes on whatever happens to spark my enthusiasm.
	If it helps anybody else, great.
	If not, at least I can enjoy the false sense of productivity.
