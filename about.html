	<h1>What's all this, then?</h1>
	<p>
	My name is Charlotte Pierce, and I'm a PhD candidate in computer science at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia.
	</p>
	<p>
	My major research interests lie in the intersection of music and technology, whether that be through teaching tools, computational analysis, assisting creative endeavours, or enhancing the listening experience.
	</p>
	<p>
	This is mostly a place for me to put up random bits of work and notes on whatever happens to spark my enthusiasm.
	If it helps anybody else, great.
	If not, at least I can enjoy the false sense of productivity.
	</p>
	<p>
	I have both a <a href="https://github.com/charlottepierce/">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/charlottepierce/">Bitbucket</a> account, and occasionally post work on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/marginalium">SoundCloud</a>.
